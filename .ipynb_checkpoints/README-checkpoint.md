# Concrete pad foundations

# Simple analysis of a concrete pad under the light gauge steel portal frame column

Pad may be standalone or engaged with the slab. Engagement with the slab is either in shear or in rotation. When shear engagement is utilized the portion of the slab resists the uplift forces. In such a case sufficient shear reinforcement needs to be designed between concrete pad and the slab. When the rotational engagement is utilized the moment reinforcement needs to be designed in the slab in order to resist bending moment that gets transferred to the slab.
